ACID properties

1.Atomicity
A transaction is an atomic unit; hence, all the instructions within a transaction will successfully execute, or none of them will execute.
The following transaction transfers 20 dollars from Alice’s bank account to Bob’s bank account.
If any of the instructions fail, the entire transaction should abort and rollback.

2.Consistency
A database is initially in a consistent state, and it should remain consistent after every transaction.
Suppose that the transaction in the previous example fails after Write(A_b) and the transaction is not rolled back;
then, the database will be inconsistent as the sum of Alice and Bob’s money, after the transaction, will not be equal to the amount of money they had before the transaction.

3. Isolation
If the multiple transactions are running concurrently, they should not be affected by each other

4. Durability
Changes that have been committed to the database should remain even in the case of software and hardware failure
