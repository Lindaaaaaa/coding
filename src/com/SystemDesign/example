Design instgram/ twitter
read write seperation, in case write take all connections
user timeline  -> pre- compute
fan out -> whenever user wants a timeline, just querry the timeline
push -> when a user sends , update all ppl who followed him their user timeline. issue: trump with a lot of followers
pull -> consistent pull from the server, see any updates from my followers
hybrid solution -> user not has many follwers/ a lot of writes, using push. otherwise no
